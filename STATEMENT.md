# Football Tournament Search System

#Project Statement
The **Football Tournament Search System** is a Python-based interactive program designed to help users quickly search and view winners of two major football competitions:
**FIFA World Cup (1930–2022)**
**UEFA Champions League (2000–2025)**

This program provides an easy-to-use menu-driven interface where the user can:
1. Search the winner of a specific FIFA World Cup year.
2. Search the winner of a specific UEFA Champions League season.
3. Display a full list of all FIFA World Cup winners.
4. Display a full list of all UEFA Champions League winners.
5. Exit the program.

# System Overview
The system uses two dictionaries:

* `fifa_world_cup_winners`: Stores FIFA winners from **1930 to 2022**.
* `ucl_winners`: Stores UEFA Champions League winners from **2000 to 2025**.

Users enter a year, and the system checks whether the year exists in the dictionary before displaying the winner.

# Features
# ✔ FIFA World Cup Search
* User inputs a year between 1930 and 2022.
* System displays the winning country.

### ✔ UEFA Champions League Search
* User inputs a year between 2000 and 2025.
* System displays the winning club.

### ✔ View All Winners
* Displays complete lists of both tournaments.

### ✔ Error Handling
* Rejects years outside the available tournament range.
* Prevents invalid menu choices.

## Technology Used
* **Python Programming Language**
* Dictionary Data Structures
* Menu-driven User Interface

# Purpose of the Project
This project helps football enthusiasts, students, and data researchers easily explore historical winners of global football tournaments. It is ideal for:
* Learning Python basics (input, loops, conditionals)
* Understanding search operations
* Building sports-data applications

# Conclusion
The Football Tournament Search System is a clean, simple Python project that delivers fast and accurate results. It can be expanded further by adding:
* More competition categories
* Search by country/club
* GUI or web interface
